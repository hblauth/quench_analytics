✅ MVP Build Plan: Ecommerce Marketing Analytics (GCP)

🧱 PHASE 1: Infrastructure Setup
✅ 1.1 – Initialize Terraform Project
Start: Terraform is installed locally
End: Terraform initialized and ready to plan/apply

✅ Test: terraform init successful

✅ 1.2 – Create GCS Buckets via Terraform
Start: Terraform initialized
End: GCS buckets raw-data and function-logs created

✅ Test: gsutil ls returns both buckets

✅ 1.3 – Create BigQuery Datasets
Start: GCS buckets deployed
End: raw, staging, and analytics datasets created

✅ Test: Console or bq ls shows the datasets

⚙️ PHASE 2: Google Ads API Ingestion (Single Source)
✅ 2.1 – Write Google Ads Client Script (Local)
Start: Google Ads token available
End: main.py makes successful API call and saves to local file

✅ Test: google_ads_response.json saved with real campaign data

✅ 2.2 – Save Response to GCS (Local Test)
Start: Script pulls Google Ads data
End: Script saves YYYY-MM-DD_google_ads.json to GCS bucket

✅ Test: gs://raw-data/google_ads/<date>/file.json exists

✅ 2.3 – Deploy Script as Cloud Function
Start: Script works locally
End: Cloud Function deployed and callable via HTTP

✅ Test: curl $FUNCTION_URL triggers data to GCS

✅ 2.4 – Schedule Function with Cloud Scheduler
Start: Cloud Function live
End: Scheduler runs function every Monday at 6AM UTC

✅ Test: Confirm job scheduled and last run succeeded

🧪 PHASE 3: BigQuery Raw Load + Transformation
✅ 3.1 – Load GCS JSON to Raw Table
Start: JSON in GCS
End: Table raw.google_ads_campaigns created from file

✅ Test: Table appears in BigQuery with correct schema

✅ 3.2 – Create dbt Project Scaffold
Start: dbt installed locally
End: dbt init quench_analytics creates working folder

✅ Test: dbt debug shows all green

✅ 3.3 – Create stg_google_ads Staging Model
Start: Raw table exists
End: dbt model stg_google_ads.sql transforms raw to typed format

✅ Test: dbt run creates staging.stg_google_ads table

✅ 3.4 – Create campaign_summary Analytics Model
Start: Staging model built
End: dbt model campaign_summary.sql aggregates spend per campaign

✅ Test: Output table exists in analytics with correct aggregates

📊 PHASE 4: Dashboard MVP
✅ 4.1 – Connect BigQuery to Looker Studio
Start: Final model exists in analytics
End: Looker Studio shows live preview of campaign_summary

✅ Test: Table with campaign IDs and spend is visible

✅ 4.2 – Create Basic Dashboard Report
Start: BQ source connected
End: Dashboard shows weekly spend and # campaigns

✅ Test: Shareable link works, values update weekly after ingestion

📣 PHASE 5: Feedback + Iteration Hooks
✅ 5.1 – Add Logging to Google Ads Function
Start: Function works end-to-end
End: All stages (auth, fetch, write) log to stdout

✅ Test: Logs visible in Cloud Logging console

✅ 5.2 – Add Alert on Function Failure
Start: Logging in place
End: Alert email if function errors out

✅ Test: Trigger error manually, receive alert

✅ 5.3 – Document API Schema & Storage Location
Start: One API integrated
End: docs/architecture.md describes Google Ads endpoint and file schema

✅ Test: Markdown file includes sample JSON + schema mapping

📌 MVP Exit Criteria
✅ Google Ads data pulled, stored, and transformed

✅ Output visible in BigQuery and dashboard

✅ Fully scheduled and automated

✅ Logging + alerting in place

✅ Documentation started
